# Homework 2.5

## Operators

### Comparison Operators

- **Equal `==`:** Does the expression on the left equal the expression on the right?
    - `12 == 12` True
    - `5 == "5"` False
- **Not equal `!=`:** Does the expression on the left *not* equal the expression on the right?
    - `12 != 12` False
    - `5 != "5"` True


1. What is the value of `result`?

    ``` cs
    int x = 20;
    int y = 10;
    bool result = x % y == 0;
    ```

    > !True
    > False

2. What is the value of `result`?

    ``` cs
    string a = "foo";
    string b = "bar";
    bool result = a + b != "foobar";
    ```

    > True
    > !False

### More Comparison Operators

- **Less than `<`:** is the expression on the left less than the expression on the right?
    - `1 < 2` True
    - `8 < 8` False
- **Less than or equal to `<=`:** Is the expression on the left less than *or equal to* the expression on the right?
    - `1 <= 2` True
    - `8 <= 8` True
- **Greater than `>`:** Inverse of less than `<`.
- **Greater than or equal to `>=`**: Inverse of less than or equal to `<=`.


1. What is the value of `result`?

    ``` cs
    int a = 12;
    int b = 20;
    bool result = a > b;
    ```

    > True
    > !False

2. What is the value of `result`?

    ``` cs
    string a = new DateTime(2015, 10, 1);
    string b = new DateTime(2015, 11, 1);
    result = a > b;
    ```

	> True
	> !False

### Conditional Operators

- **Boolean AND `&&`:** Are the expressions to the left **and** right true?
    - `5 > 3 && "foo" != "bar"` True
    - `10 <= 5 && "baz" == "baz"` False (`10` is not *less than or equal* to `5`)
- ** Boolean OR `||`:** Are either the expression to the left or the right true?
    - `5 > 3 || "foo" != "bar"` Both are true
    - `10 <= 5 || "baz" == "baz"` True (while the first condition fails, the second condition succeeds)


1. What will this program's output be?

    ``` cs
    decimal a = 12.01m;
    decimal b = 15.24m;

    if (a < b && a + b >=  17)
    {
	    Console.WriteLine("Foo");
    }
    else
    {
	    Console.WriteLine("Bar");
    }
    ```

	> !Foo
	> Bar
	> Nothing

2. What will this program's output be?

	``` cs
	var x = "Ralph";
	var y = "Eddie";

	if (x.StartsWith("Q") || (x + y).Length >= 8)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Foo");
	}
	else
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Bar");
	}
	```

	> !Foo
	> Bar
	> Nothing

3. What will this program's output be?

    ``` cs
    var date = new DateTime(2015, 10, 27);

    if (date.Year % 4 == 0)
    {
	    Console.WriteLine("A");
    }
    else if (date.DayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.Tuesday && date.Day == 26)
    {
	    Console.WriteLine("B");
    }
    else if (date.Day / 26 == 1 || date.Year % 5 == 0 && date.Month != 1)
    {
	    Console.WriteLine("C");
    }
    else
    {
	    Console.WriteLine("D");
    }
    ```

	> A
	> B
	> !C
	> D

## Types

Every variable has a type. The type of a variable determines how it will behave in any given situation. There are too many to cover every one, but there is usually a best type for every
situation. Please see [Value Types][val] and [Reference Types][ref].

### Value Types

[Values types][val] are any type that, when assigned to another variable its *value* is copied. Any modifications made to the value do not affect other copies.
Most value types are also *immutable*, a `5` is a `5` and will always be a `5`. All you can do is assign a new *value* to the variable.
E.g. `x` is `5` only until I assign a new value of `6` to `x`.

This will make more sense once you understand how [reference types][ref] work, later.

Some notable [value types][val]:
- [int](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5kzh1b5w.aspx)
- [double](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/678hzkk9.aspx)
- [decimal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/364x0z75.aspx)
- [char](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x9h8tsay.aspx)
- [struct]

**Example:**
``` cs
// Integers
int x = 5;
int y = x;

x = 10;

Console.WriteLine(x); // 10
Console.WriteLine(y); // 5

// Structs (DateTime)
DateTime start = new DateTime(2015, 12, 1);
DateTime end = start;

end = end.AddDays(30);

Console.WriteLine(start.ToShortDateString()); // 12/01/2015
Console.WriteLine(end.ToShortDateString());   // 12/31/2015
```


1. What is the final value of `x`?

    ``` cs
    var x = 5;
    var y = x + 1;

    x += 2;
    y += x + 5;
    ```

    > `5`
    > `12`
    > `13`
    > !`7`

2. What is the final value of `q`?

    ``` cs
    var q = 5.0m;
    var r = q;
    var s = q;

    r -= 1;
    s += 2;
    r -= q * 10;
    ```

    > !`5.0m`
    > `4.0m`
    > `7.0m`
    > `-46.0m`

#### Structures (value type)

Structures are specialized value types with some added-on features. The most prevalent example of this is the [`DateTime`][date] type.
`DateTime` has some handy methods for date manipulation. E.g. `myDate.AddDays(-30)` to subtract 30 days from a given date.

Subtracting two `DateTime` objects from one another will yield you a `TimeSpan` object that has duration-specific methods that are
helpful, such as `myTimeSpan.TotalSeconds` to retrieve the value of a `TimeSpan` in seconds.

Some notable built-in [structures][struct]:

- [DateTime][date]
- [TimeSpan][ts]

[date]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime(v=vs.110).aspx
[ts]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.timespan(v=vs.110).aspx
[struct]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ah19swz4.aspx


1. What is the final value of `a`?

    ``` cs
    var a = new DateTime(2015, 1, 1);
    var b = a;

    b = b.AddYears(1);
    a.AddDays(7);
    ```
    *Note that value types are immutable, so the assignment operator `=` is important.*

    > January 1, 2016
    > January 8, 2016
    > !January 1, 2015

### Reference Types

[Reference types][ref] are any type that, when assigned to another variable, passes a reference to its value. Reference types
can be mutable or immutable, depending on the way they were built.

Some notable [reference types][ref]:
- [string](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/362314fe.aspx) *(`string` behaves very much like a [value type][val])*
- [object](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9kkx3h3c.aspx)
- [class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0b0thckt.aspx)

**Example:**
``` cs
// Here is a basic example of a class
public class MyClass
{
    public int MyNumber;
}

var x = new MyClass();
var y = x;

x.MyNumber = 25;

Console.WriteLine(x.MyNumber); // 25
Console.WriteLine(y.MyNumber); // 25

y.MyNumber = -13;

Console.WriteLine(x.MyNumber); // -13
Console.WriteLine(y.MyNumber); // -13
```

In the above example, both `x` and `y` were *references* to the same reference type, in this case a `class` called `MyClass`.


1. Given the above class, `MyClass`, what will be the value of `r.MyNumber`?

    ``` cs
    var q = new MyClass();
    var r = q;
    var x = 22;

    q.MyNumber = x;

    x += 1;
    x = 50;
    q.MyNumber += x;
    ```

    > !`72`
    > `23`
    > `22`
    > `50`

2. What will be the value of `x.Name`?

    ``` cs
    public class Person
    {
        public string Name;
        public int Age;
    }

    var x = new Person();
    var y = new Person();

    var name1 = "Jack";
    var name2 = "Jill";
    var a = 21;

    x.Name = name1;
    x.Age = a--;
    y.Name = name2;
    y.Age = a;

    name1 = "John";
    name2 = "Jane";
    ```
    *Remember, `string` behaves like a [value type][val].*

    > Jane
    > !Jack
    > John
    > Jill
