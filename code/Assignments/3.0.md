# Homework 3.0

## Enumerations

Enums, or *enumerations*, are a list of enumerated values starting at 0 with each subsequent item incrementing their value by one.

``` cs
public enum Fruit
{
    Apple,
    Banana,
    Orange
}

Console.WriteLine((int)Fruit.Orange); // 2
```

You can start enums at any number you want and they will increment from there.

``` cs
public enum Fruit
{
    Apple = 15,
    Banana,
    Orange
}

Console.WriteLine((int)Fruit.Orange); // 17
```

You can also change the number anywhere in the middle, or assign each item specific numbers.

``` cs
public enum Fruit
{
    Apple = 1000,
    Banana = 10,
    Pear,
    Orange = 15
}

Console.WriteLine((int)Fruit.Pear); // 11
```

`DayOfWeek` is a built-in `enum` provided by the `System.Date` namespace. 

``` cs
public enum DayOfWeek
{
    Sunday,
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday
}
```

1. What is the value of `(int)DayOfWeek.Tuesday`?

    > 0
    > 1
    > !2
    > 3

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a procedure or formula for solving a problem.

Here's a simple algorithm for finding the nearest Tuesday for a given date.

``` cs
public static DateTime GetNearestTuesday(DateTime date)
{
    if (date.DayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.Tuesday)
    {
        return date;
    }

    var forwardCount = 0;
    var testDate = date;
    while (testDate.DayOfWeek != DayOfWeek.Tuesday)
    {
        testDate = testDate.AddDays(1);
        forwardCount++;
    }

    var backwardCount = 0;
    testDate = date; // reset test date
    while (testDate.DayOfWeek != DayOfWeek.Tuesday)
    {
        testDate = testDate.AddDays(-1);
        backwardCount++;
    }

    if (backwardCount < forwardCount)
    {
        return date.AddDays(-backwardCount);
    }
    return date.AddDays(forwardCount);
}
```

2. Which of the following would be an effective test to make sure the above algorithm works?
*Note: `Assert` is a suite of assertions one can use in one's code. E.g. 
<code class='prettyprint language-cs'>Assert.IsTrue(1 == 2);</code> will throw an error because
`1` **does not equal** `2`. If the assertion is valid then no error is thrown.*

    For the following answers:
    ``` cs
    var result = GetNearestTuesday(new DateTime(2015, 12, 17));
    ```

    > <code class='prettyprint language-cs'>Assert.AreNotEqual(result, new DateTime(2015, 12, 17));</code>
    > <code class='prettyprint language-cs'>Assert.AreEqual(result.DayOfWeek, DayOfWeek.Tuesday);</code>
    > <code class='prettyprint language-cs'>Assert.IsTrue(result == new DateTime(2015, 12, 22));</code>
    > !<code class='prettyprint language-cs'>Assert.AreEqual(result, new DateTime(2015, 12, 15));</code>

3. What would be the expected output for the following code:

    ``` cs
    var result = GetNearestTuesday(new DateTime(2016, 1, 1));
    Console.WriteLine(result.ToShortDateString()); // Will print in MM/DD/YYYY format
    ```

    > !12/29/2015
    > 12/29/2016
    > 01/05/2016
    > 01/05/2015

## Methods

The algorithm presented above is encapsulated in a *method*. Methods, also known as *functions*,
are useful for recycling algorithms multiple times, instead of having to copy and paste lines of
code for repeated uses.

For example, the following program capitalizes a person's name every time it refers to them:
``` cs
Console.Write("What is your name?> ");
var name = Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name.Substring(0, 1).ToUpper() + name.Substring(1) + "!");
Console.WriteLine(name.Substring(0, 1).ToUpper() + name.Substring(1) + " really is a great name.");
Console.WriteLine("How do you like being named " + name.Substring(0, 1).ToUpper() + name.Substring(1) + "?");
```

This code can be greatly simplified by factoring out the capitalization work.

``` cs
public static Capitalize(string text)
{
    return text.Substring(0, 1).ToUpper() + text.Substring(1);
}

Console.Write("What is your name?> ");
var name = Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + Capitalize(name) + "!");
Console.WriteLine(Capitalize(name) + " really is a great name.");
Console.WriteLine("How do you like being named " + Capitalize(name) + "?");
```

In addition to simplifying the code we also get the added benefit that any further changes or improvements that we make
to our `Capitalize` method are immediately applied to anywhere the method is used.

Obviously there's other ways to improve the above program, but you get the idea of the usefulness of methods.

4. Rewrite the above `GetNearestTuesday` method to accept any given day of the week and calculate the nearest day to that day of the week.
Write it such that it can be used as follows.

    ``` cs
    var result = GetNearestDay(new DateTime(2016, 1, 1), DayOfWeek.Saturday);
    Console.WriteLine(result.ToShortDateString()); // Result should be 01/02/2016
    ```

5. Write a method to factor out the algorithm that determines the units of time until the given holidays to simplify the following program.

    ``` cs
    var date = DateTime.Now;
    var xmas = new DateTime(2015, 12, 25);
    var nyd = new DateTime(2016, 1, 1);
    var ind = new DateTime(2016, 7, 4);

    Console.WriteLine("Just so you know...");

    int days;
    int hours;
    int minutes;
    int seconds;

    var diff = (xmas - date);
    var weeks = (int)diff.TotalDays / 7;
    if (weeks > 0)
    {
        days = (int)diff.TotalDays % (weeks * 7);
    }
    else
    {
        days = (int)diff.TotalDays;
    }
    if (days > 0)
    {
        hours = (int)diff.TotalHours % ((int)diff.TotalDays * 24);
    }
    else
    {
        hours = (int)diff.TotalHours;
    }
    if (hours > 0)
    {
        minutes = (int)diff.TotalMinutes % ((int)diff.TotalHours * 60);
    }
    else
    {
        minutes = (int)diff.TotalMinutes;
    }
    if (minutes > 0)
    {
        seconds = (int)diff.TotalSeconds % ((int)diff.TotalMinutes * 60);
    }
    else
    {
        seconds = (int)diff.TotalSeconds;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("There's {0} weeks, {1} days, {2} hours, {3} minutes, and {4} seconds until Christmas", weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds));

    diff = (nyd - date);
    weeks = (int)diff.TotalDays / 7;
    if (weeks > 0)
    {
        days = (int)diff.TotalDays % (weeks * 7);
    }
    else
    {
        days = (int)diff.TotalDays;
    }
    if (days > 0)
    {
        hours = (int)diff.TotalHours % ((int)diff.TotalDays * 24);
    }
    else
    {
        hours = (int)diff.TotalHours;
    }
    if (hours > 0)
    {
        minutes = (int)diff.TotalMinutes % ((int)diff.TotalHours * 60);
    }
    else
    {
        minutes = (int)diff.TotalMinutes;
    }
    if (minutes > 0)
    {
        seconds = (int)diff.TotalSeconds % ((int)diff.TotalMinutes * 60);
    }
    else
    {
        seconds = (int)diff.TotalSeconds;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("There's {0} weeks, {1} days, {2} hours, {3} minutes, and {4} seconds until New Year's Day", weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds));

    diff = (ind - date);
    weeks = (int)diff.TotalDays / 7;
    if (weeks > 0)
    {
        days = (int)diff.TotalDays % (weeks * 7);
    }
    else
    {
        days = (int)diff.TotalDays;
    }
    if (days > 0)
    {
        hours = (int)diff.TotalHours % ((int)diff.TotalDays * 24);
    }
    else
    {
        hours = (int)diff.TotalHours;
    }
    if (hours > 0)
    {
        minutes = (int)diff.TotalMinutes % ((int)diff.TotalHours * 60);
    }
    else
    {
        minutes = (int)diff.TotalMinutes;
    }
    if (minutes > 0)
    {
        seconds = (int)diff.TotalSeconds % ((int)diff.TotalMinutes * 60);
    }
    else
    {
        seconds = (int)diff.TotalSeconds;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("There's {0} weeks, {1} days, {2} hours, {3} minutes, and {4} seconds until Independence Day", weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds));
    ```
