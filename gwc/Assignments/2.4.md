# Homework 2.4

## Operators

There are several different kinds of operators. Some that you are already familiar
with: addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`. Then some
more advanced ones as follows:

- **Modulo `%`:** returns the remainder after division (e.g. `5 % 2 = 1` &mdash; 2 divides
evenly into 5 twice, leaving a remainder of 1).
- **Concatenation `+`:** You're already probably familiar with this, but `+` is not only
used for adding numbers. It also *concatenates* two strings, e.g. `"Hello " + ", world!"`
gives you a single string, `"Hello, world!"`.
    - It's important to note the *type* of the variable you are working with. Adding
`1 + 2` gives you 3, while adding `"1" + "2"` gives you `"12"` &mdash; `int` vs `string`.


1. What is the value of `x`?

    ``` cs
    var x = 10 % 4;
    ```

    > 1
    > !2
    > 3
    > 4

2. What is the value of `y`?

    ``` cs
    var a = "20";
    var b = "15";
    var y = a + b;
    ```

    > `"20"`
    > `35`
    > !`"2015"`
    > `"1520"`

### Compound Assignment Operators

You already know `=` assigns the given value to a variable, e.g. `var x = 0;`. Plus, you may
have already seen a number of other assignment operators in use. Take a look at the following:

- **Plus equals `+=`:** This will add the value of the variable on the *left* to the expression on
the *right* and assign the resulting value back to the variable on the *left*.
    - `x += 10` is semantically equal to `x = x + 10`
    - `x += y * 4` is semantically equal to `x = x + y * 4`
- **Minus equals `-=`:** This will subtract the value of the variable on the *left* from the
expression on the *right* and assign the resulting value back to the variable on the *left*.
- Other mathematical operations work the same way, e.g. `x /= 2` means `x = x / 2`, `x *= 10` means
`x = x * 10`. You get the idea.


1. What will be the final value of `a`?

    ``` cs
    var a = 100;
    var b = 5;
    a /= b;
    ```

    > !`20`
    > `50`
    > `5`
    > `100`

2. What will be the final value of `z`?

    ``` cs
    var z = 20;
    var y = z * 2;
    z *= 10;
    ```

    > `20`
    > `400`
    > !`200`
    > `40`

3. What will be the final value of `x`?

    ``` cs
    var x = 0;
    var y = 20;
    var z = 3;
    y = x + 2;
    z *= x + y;
    ```

    > !`0`
    > `6`
    > `2`
    > `5`

### Unary Operators

Unary operators are operators that affect only one variable, and they work a couple of
different ways.

- **Increment `++`:** The increment operator simply adds one to a numeric variable, `x++` is simply `x = x + 1`
- **Decrement `--`:** Decrement works much the same way, `x--` is `x = x - 1`

One important thing to note about increment and decrement is the placement of the operator
determines its *immediate* value.

For example, if we *postfix* (place the operator after) the variable then it will use
its **current** value in the expression and increment the value of the variable **afterwards**.

``` cs
var x = 1;
Console.WriteLine(x++); // Will print "1"
Console.WriteLine(x); // Will print "2"
```

If, however, we *prefix* (place the operator before) the variable, it will **immediately**
alter the value of the variable.

``` cs
var y = 20;
Console.WriteLine(--y); // Will print "19"
Console.WriteLine(y); // Will print "19"
```


1. What will be the final value of `q`?

    ``` cs
    var q = 3;
    q--;
    ```

    > 4
    > 3
    > !2
    > 1

2. What will be the final value of `r`?

    ``` cs
    var r = 20;
    while (--r > 10) { }
    ```
    *Note the prefix or postix position of the decrement.*

    > !10
    > 11
    > 9
    > 20

3. What will be the final value of `c`?

    ``` cs
    var c = 0;
    do
    {
    } while (c++ < 5);
    ```
    *Note the prefix or postix position of the increment.*

    > 5
    > 0
    > !6
    > 4

## Bring it All Together

1. What will be the final value of `age`?

    ``` cs
    var age = 0;
    var birthYear = 1981;
    var currentYear = 2016;
    var hasHadBirthday = false;

    while (birthYear < currentYear)
    {
        age++;
        currentYear--;
    }

    if (hasHadBirthday == false)
    {
        age--;
    }
    ```

    > 33
    > !34
    > 35
    > 0

2. What will be the final value of `age`?

    ``` cs
    var age = 0;
    var birthYear = 1953;
    var currentYear = 2015;
    var hasHadBirthday = true;

    // Sometimes people use for loops like this.
    // I think it's hard to read, but see if you can follow how it works
    for (; birthYear < currentYear--; age++) { }

    if (hasHadBirthday == false)
    {
        age--;
    }
    ```

    > 60
    > 61
    > !62
    > 59

3. What will be the final value of `wages`?

    ``` cs
    decimal hourly = 10.00m; // decimal is a type well-suited for currency
    int hoursPerWeek = 10;

    // First get monthly wages
    decimal wages = hoursPerWeek * hourly;

    // Then get annual wages
    wages *= 52;
    ```

    > `10`
    > !`5200`
    > `100`
    > `520`

4. The following function should (and does) have the exact same result as the above. What would happen if we changed `continue` to
`break` in the `if` clause?

    ``` cs
    decimal hourly = 10.00m;
    int hoursPerDay = 10;
    decimal wages = 0m;

    // Assume we get paid for every weekday
    var startDate = new DateTime(2015, 1, 1);
    var endDate = new DateTime(2015, 12, 31);
    
    for (var currentDate = startDate; currentDate < endDate; currentDate = currentDate.AddDays(1))
    {
        if ((int)currentDate.DayOfWeek == 0 || (int)currentDate.DayOfWeek == 6) // 0 is Sunday, 6 is Saturday
        {
            continue; // skips the rest of the loop body and goes to the next cycle
        }
        wages += hoursPerDay * hourly;
    }
    ```

    > The value of `wages` would no longer exclude weekends
    > The value of `wages` would be only for weekends
    > Nothing
    > !The loop would exit on the first encountered weekend

## Bonus

1. Write a program that produces the following output:

    ``` console
    @Enter a name: Joey
    @Enter a noun: car
    @Enter an adjective: shiny
    @Enter another name: Janet
    @Enter another adjective: giant

    >One night Joey jumped into a shiny car. While doing so
    >suddenly giant Janet called and let Joey know that they had
    >both forgotten about Dre.
    ```

    *Extra gold stars for making the output type out one character at a time.*
