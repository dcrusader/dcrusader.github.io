## Variable Declarations

You&rsquo;ve probably noticed there's a couple of ways to declare a variable, `var`, `let`, and one you may not have seen yet is `const`.

- var

    The `var` declaration is `function` scoped, meaning that the variable is accessible anywhere in the function that it was declared.

    ``` js
    function myFunction() {
        console.log(x); // will print "undefined"

        var x = "foo";

        console.log(x); // will print "foo"
    }
    ```

- let

    The `let` declaration is `block` scoped, meaning that the variable is accessible only in the code block that it was declared.

    ``` js
    function myFunction() {
        console.log(x); // this will cause an error

        let x = "bar";

        console.log(x); // will print "bar"
    }
    ```

- const

    The `const` declaration is also `block` scoped, but its main difference from `let` is that you cannot change the variable's value
    after it is declared.

    ``` js
    function myFunction() {
        const x = "baz";
        console.log(x); // will print "baz"

        x = "foo"; // this will cause an error
    }
    ```

## Operators

### Comparison Operators

- **Equal `==`:** Does the expression on the left equal the expression on the right?
    - `12 == 12` True
    - `5 == "5"` False
- **Not equal `!=`:** Does the expression on the left *not* equal the expression on the right?
    - `12 != 12` False
    - `5 != "5"` True


1. What is the value of `result`?

    ``` js
    const x = 20;
    const y = 10;
    const result = x % y == 0;
    ```

    > !True
    > False

2. What is the value of `result`?

    ``` js
    const a = "foo";
    const b = "bar";
    const result = a + b !== "foobar";
    ```

    > True
    > !False

### More Comparison Operators

- **Less than `<`:** is the expression on the left less than the expression on the right?
    - `1 < 2` True
    - `8 < 8` False
- **Less than or equal to `<=`:** Is the expression on the left less than *or equal to* the expression on the right?
    - `1 <= 2` True
    - `8 <= 8` True
- **Greater than `>`:** Inverse of less than `<`.
- **Greater than or equal to `>=`**: Inverse of less than or equal to `<=`.


1. What is the value of `result`?

    ``` js
    const a = 12;
    const b = 20;
    const result = a > b;
    ```

    > True
    > !False

2. What is the value of `result`?

    ``` js
    const a = new Date(2015, 10, 1);
    const b = new Date(2015, 11, 1);
    result = a > b;
    ```

	> True
	> !False

### Conditional Operators

- **Boolean AND `&&`:** Are the expressions to the left **and** right true?
    - `5 > 3 && "foo" != "bar"` True
    - `10 <= 5 && "baz" === "baz"` False (`10` is not *less than or equal* to `5`)
- ** Boolean OR `||`:** Are either the expression to the left or the right true?
    - `5 > 3 || "foo" != "bar"` Both are true
    - `10 <= 5 || "baz" === "baz"` True (while the first condition fails, the second condition succeeds)


1. What will this program's output be?

    ``` js
    const a = 12.01;
    const b = 15.24;

    if (a < b && a + b >=  17)
    {
	    console.log("Foo");
    }
    else
    {
	    console.log("Bar");
    }
    ```

	> !Foo
	> Bar
	> Nothing

2. What will this program's output be?

	``` cs
	const x = "Ralph";
	const y = "Eddie";

	if (x.indexOf("Q") === 0 || (x + y).length >= 8) // indexOf will return the index in a string or array where it finds the given value
	{
		console.log("Foo");
	}
	else
	{
		console.log("Bar");
	}
	```

	> !Foo
	> Bar
	> Nothing

3. What will this program's output be?

    ``` js
    const date = new Date(2015, 10, 27);

    if (date.getYear() % 4 === 0)
    {
	    console.log("A");
    }
    else if (date.getDay() === 2 && date.getDate() === 26)
    {
	    console.log("B");
    }
    else if (date.getDate() / 26 === 1 || date.getYear() % 5 === 0 && date.getMonth() !== 1)
    {
	    console.log("C");
    }
    else
    {
	    console.log("D");
    }
    ```

	> A
	> B
	> !C
	> D

## Types

Every variable has a type. The type of a variable determines how it will behave in any given situation. There are too many to cover every one, but there is usually a best type for every situation. Please see [Value Types][val] and [Reference Types][ref].

### Value Types

[Values types][val] are any type that, when assigned to another variable its *value* is copied. Any modifications made to the value do not affect other copies.
Most value types are also *immutable*, a `5` is a `5` and will always be a `5`. All you can do is assign a new *value* to the variable.
E.g. `x` is `5` only until I assign a new value of `6` to `x`.

This will make more sense once you understand how [reference types][ref] work, later.

**Example:**
``` js
// Integers
let x = 5;
const y = x;

x = 10;

console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 5

// Objects
const start = new Date(2015, 11, 1);
const end = new Date(start);

// This changes the value of end after it's declared
// You may be thinking, "But wait, won't that cause an error since it was declared with const?"
// Since we're working with an object, the next statement simply changes a property of the Date object
// on the *instance* of the object that we are working with.
// The end variable itself is still assigned to that instnace of the object, so we're not breaking
// any rules
end.setDate(end.getDate() + 30);

console.log(start.toLocaleDateString("en-US")); // 12/01/2015
console.log(end.toLocaleDateString("en-US"));   // 12/31/2015
```


1. What is the final value of `x`?

    ``` js
    let x = 5;
    let y = x + 1;

    x += 2;
    y += x + 5;
    ```

    > `5`
    > `12`
    > `13`
    > !`7`

2. What is the final value of `q`?

    ``` js
    let q = 5.0;
    let r = q;
    let s = q;

    r -= 1;
    s += 2;
    r -= q * 10;
    ```

    > !`5`
    > `4`
    > `7`
    > `-46`

### Reference Types

[Reference types][ref] are any type that, when assigned to another variable, passes a reference to its value. Reference types
can be mutable or immutable, depending on the way they were built.

**Example:**
``` js
// Here is a basic example of a class
class MyClass
{
    constructor() {
        this.MyNumber = 0;
    }
}

const x = new MyClass();
const y = x;

x.MyNumber = 25;

console.log(x.MyNumber); // 25
console.log(y.MyNumber); // 25

y.MyNumber = -13;

console.log(x.MyNumber); // -13
console.log(y.MyNumber); // -13
```

In the above example, both `x` and `y` were *references* to the same reference type, in this case an `object` called `MyClass`.


1. Given the above class, `MyClass`, what will be the value of `r.MyNumber`?

    ``` js
    const q = new MyClass();
    const r = q;
    let x = 22;

    r.MyNumber = x;

    x += 1;
    x = 50;
    q.MyNumber += x;
    ```

    > !`72`
    > `23`
    > `22`
    > `50`

2. What will be the value of `x.Name`?

    ``` js
    class Person
    {
        constructor() {
            this.Name = "";
            this.Age = 0;
        }
    }

    const x = new Person();
    const y = new Person();

    const name1 = "Jack";
    const name2 = "Jill";
    let a = 21;

    x.Name = name1;
    x.Age = a--;
    y.Name = name2;
    y.Age = a;

    name1 = "John";
    name2 = "Jane";
    ```
    *Remember, `string` behaves like a [value type][val].*

    > Jane
    > !Jack
    > John
    > Jill
